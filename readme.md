## Let's Grow More Web Development Internship

It is a wonderful opportunity given to students like me by LGM. We got to learn and build projects on latest technology stacks.
There were  three tasks out of which we could perform atlast two tasks.
I completed task1 and task2.

### Task 1 
Task 1 was to build a one pager static website with multiple features.

### Task 2
Task 2 was to build a react app, by fetching data from an api.
